                    <h5 class="py-3">Disclosure and Use</h5>
                    <p class="py-4">Except as provided below or with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will not: (a) disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than on a need-to-know basis to its directors, officers, members, managers, employees, affiliates, attorneys and contractors, solely to the extent and only for the purpose of performing or exercising the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations under this Agreement; (b) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, use Confidential Information other than for fulfilling the obligations or exercising the rights of the Receiving Party under this Agreement; (c) allow others to make copies of such Confidential Information except as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party’s obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement; or (d) remove or export any such Confidential Information in violation of any applicable law.  The Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, and will cause its directors, employees, attorneys, affiliates and contractors to treat such Confidential Information, with at least the same degree of care and protection as it would use with respect to its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care.
                        The obligations set forth above shall not apply with respect to the use or disclosure of information: (a) previously known to the Receiving Party without obligation of confidence; (b) independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without use of or access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and without breaching this Agreement; (c) acquired by the Receiving Party from a third party which is not under an obligation of confidence with respect to such information; or (d) which is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement.  A Receiving Party may make a disclosure of Confidential Information if required either by applicable law or legal process (as a result of legal compulsion or in order to advance a defense to a claim), in response to a request by a governmental authority or in connection with a proceeding before a court, adversary proceeding, administrative proceeding, governmental or regulatory proceeding, if (i) the Receiving Party only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information reasonably required to be disclosed; and (ii) unless prohibited by law, the Receiving Party provides reasonable notice to the Disclosing Party in advance of the disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek confidential treatment for the Confidential Information, a protective order or other appropriate remedy, relief or reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded the information so disclosed at the sole cost and expense of the Disclosing Party or consent in writing to having the Confidential Information so produced or so disclosed (which consent will extend solely to the disclosure and production in question).</p>

The Receiving Party acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure or use of such Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction enjoining any breach of the Disclosing Party’s confidentiality obligations, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.</p>

The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for commercial arbitration, including provisions for the resolution of consumer disputes, if applicable (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Either party may bring a Dispute in small claims court in Maricopa County, Arizona to the extent permitted by the Arbitration Rules. If the amount in controversy is less than $10,000, the parties agree that the Dispute will be decided on the basis of written submissions without a hearing. The decision of the arbitrator will be final without option to appeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive, special, consequential, or indirect damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be divided in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND USING THE SERVICES, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW OR BEFORE A JURY. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

Except for the payment of fees by Subscriber, if either party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out its obligations here under due to a force majeure event (i.e., act of God, strike, industrial disturbance, fire, store, flood, epidemic/pandemic, utility failure, governmental restraint, war, or other similar event), such party’s obligations under this Agreement will be suspended during the force majeure event. Subscriber agrees that ambiguities in this Agreement will not be construed against Air AI by attribution of drafting. Air AI may assign any of its rights or obligations to others at any time without notice to Subscriber. Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations to others without Air AI’s prior written consent.</p>
